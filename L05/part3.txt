QUESTION 1 : WHY ARE ALL REPORTED TIMES EQUAL TO 0 ?
   ANS - Since the processing power of the computer is very fast and the reported time is in milli or maybe nano seconds for these tasks,
         it is shown to 0

QUESTION 2 : Why is factors_itr only called once every time the program is run?
 ANS - Since the factors_itr is a iterative function which loops in some given range, it doesnt need to be called again and again. 
       That's why it is called only once
       
QUESTION 3 : Is there an obvious mathematical relationship between the input number and the number of
            recursive calls? What about the number of prime factors each number produces?  
            
ANS -   Yes, Since a recursive function calls itself in it , it has to run multiple times. Yes , the relation between number of inputs and recursive calls  
        is clone to 2^n. This is due to the fact that each prime factor of the input number causes the factor function to be called recursively. The number                 
        of prime factors of the input number is proportional to the square root of the input number because the algorithm used in the factors.c file to 
        discover the prime factors of a number is based on trial division. Because of this, the quantity of recursive calls is related to the square root 
        of the input integer.
        
        For example factorial of a number is n*fact(n-1) 
        and when n=0 or 1, fact =1, so recursive function gives n-1 recursive calls if input is n.
