QUESTION 1 : WHY ARE ALL REPORTED TIMES EQUAL TO 0 ?
   ANS - Since the processing power of the computer is very fast and the reported time is in milli or maybe nano seconds for these tasks,
         it is shown to 0

QUESTION 2 : Why is factors_itr only called once every time the program is run?
 ANS - Since the factors_itr is a iterative function which loops in some given range, it doesnt need to be called again and again. 
       That's why it is called only once
       
QUESTION 3 : Is there an obvious mathematical relationship between the input number and the number of
            recursive calls? What about the number of prime factors each number produces?  
            
ANS -   Yes, Since a recursive function calls itself in it , it has to run multiple times. Yes the number of inputs and number of recursive calls are                 directly proportional and the actual relation is close to 2^n  where n is the number of inputs.
For example factorial of a number is n*fact(n-1) 
        and when n=0 or 1, fact =1, so recursive function gives n-1 recursive calls if input is n.
